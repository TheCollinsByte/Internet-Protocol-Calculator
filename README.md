# What is an IP Address?
An IP address is a string of number separed by periods. IP addresses are expressed as a set of four numbers.

``` Address
192.158.1.38
Each number in the set can range from 0 to 255. 
So, the full IP addressing range goes from 0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255
```

IP addresses are not random. They are mathematically produced and allocated by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), a division of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). ICANN is a non-profit organization that was established in the United States in 1998 to help maintain the security of the internet and allow it to be usable by all. Each time anyone registers a domain on the internet, they go through a domain name registrar, who pays a small fee to ICANN to register the domain.
